# Experience Classification Project

The original `Experience_Classification.ipynb` notebook provided a baseline classification rate of:

* Classified: 2.07%
* Undefined: 97.93%

After careful analysis of the provided code, particularly the `patterns` list, several adjustments were made to the model. The resulting model achieved a  improved classification rate, as shown in the uploaded `experience.ipynb` notebook:

* Classified: 7.41%
* Undefined: 92.59%



## Future Work
* **Larger Datasets:** Training the model on larger datasets can lead to more robust and accurate classifications.
* **Different Language Models:** Exploring different language models, especially those based on root word matching, can provide additional insights and potentially improve results.
